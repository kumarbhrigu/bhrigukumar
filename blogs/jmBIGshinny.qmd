# ðŸ“¢ Introduction to the **jmBIG** Shiny App

The **jmBIG** Shiny app provides powerful analytical tools tailored for **BIG data**, where the number of observations (rows) is extremely large. It enables users to perform **joint modeling** of longitudinal and time-to-event data through an intuitive interface, facilitating predictive modeling and statistical inference in large-scale studies.

Joint modeling is particularly valuable in **medical research**, where the goal is often to understand the dynamic relationship between a **longitudinal biomarker** (e.g., repeated lab measures) and a **clinical outcome** (e.g., survival, disease progression). This app allows researchers and clinicians to explore such relationships and make **subject-specific predictions** about health outcomes over time.

## ðŸ”§ What the App Offers

- A suite of four joint modeling functions, built on top of:
  - [`JMbayes2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=JMbayes2)
  - [`FastJM`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=FastJM)
  - [`rstanarm`](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/)
  - [`joineRML`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=joineRML)

- Each function accommodates:
  - **Longitudinal submodel**: e.g., `y ~ 1 + x1` (fixed effects), and `~ 1 | id` (random effects)
  - **Survival submodel**: e.g., `Surv(time, status) ~ x1 + x2`
  - **Sample size input**: splits large datasets into smaller chunks for efficient processing

## ðŸ“¦ Key Features

- Fit **Bayesian** and **frequentist** joint models
- Upload your own data or use default datasets included in the `jmBIG` package
- Specify:
  - Number of MCMC chains (`nchain`)
  - Time, ID, and visit variables
  - Custom model formulas
- Designed for **flexibility** and **scalability** in BIG data settings
