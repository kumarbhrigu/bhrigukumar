# 📢 Introduction to the **lmeIPW** Shiny App

The **MIIPW** R package provides robust tools for analyzing **repeated measurement data** using a **semiparametric marginal modeling** framework. This is particularly useful when data contains **missing values** in the **response** and/or **covariates**.

The methodology integrates **Fisher Scoring** estimation with:
- **Mean Score (MS)** method
- **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)**
- **Multiple Imputation (MI)**

These approaches provide a flexible way to handle missing data scenarios, ensuring more accurate and reliable statistical inference in longitudinal data analysis.

## 🔧 Core Functions Demonstrated in the App

### 1. `lmeaipw()`
A function specifically designed for analyzing longitudinal data where the **response variable has missing values**. It uses semiparametric marginal models combined with **IPW and MI** methods.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This function should not be used if your dataset has **no missing values**.

---

### 2. `lmeipw()`
Another function for semiparametric modeling in the presence of **missing values in the response**. Like `lmeaipw()`, this function is developed for **continuous response** data and integrates both **IPW** and **multiple imputation** in the estimation process.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Avoid using this function if your data is complete (i.e., contains no missing values).

---

### 3. `lmemeanscore()`
This function implements the **Mean Score method** for marginal models when the **response variable has missing values**. It is particularly effective when used in conjunction with imputation techniques.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This function is also not appropriate if your dataset has no missing data.

## 📦 Key Features

- Handles **longitudinal data** with **missing values** in both response and covariates
- Supports **continuous outcomes** (extensions for other types of outcomes coming soon)
- Applies separate **mixed-effects models** for:
  - Imputation
  - Inverse Probability Weighting
- Suitable for use in medical, epidemiological, and health sciences research where **incomplete data** is common
